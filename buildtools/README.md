# location4j Build Tools

The location4j build tools module is a utility maven module for developing the dataset.

This module is responsible for converting open-source JSON data into a binary format that the location4j library can efficiently utilize.

Note: it is not included in the released version of the library!

## How to build a new location4j data binary

```shell
cd tools
maven clean compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.tomaytotomato.JsonToBinaryConverter"

```

This will generate a new location4j.bin file in the library's resources folder - [library/src/main/resources](library/src/main/resources)
