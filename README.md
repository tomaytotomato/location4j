location4j is a library for Java that provides data lookups for countries, states and cities along with a parsing and search service.

There are no calls to 3rd party Geolocation services e.g. (Google Maps) or LLMs like ChatGPT. 

location4j can parse and retrieve countries, states and cities from simple text formatted or unformatted.

e.g. 

```java
List<Location> results = searchLocationService.search("san francisco");

//print off each location in the world with a city called San Francisco - 16 locations
results.forEach(location -> {
    System.out.println("Country: " + location.getCountryName());
    System.out.println("State: " + location.getStateName());
    System.out.println("State Code: " + location.getStateCode());
});


List<Location> resultsNarrowed = searchLocationService.search("san francisco, us");

//print off each location in the world with a city called San Francisco in the United States
results.forEach(location -> {
    System.out.println("Country: " + location.getCountryName());
    System.out.println("State: " + location.getStateName());
    System.out.println("State Code: " + location.getStateCode());
});
```


## What can location4j do?

location4j consumes a dataset of countries, states and cities (major population centres).

| Feature                      | Supported | Object  |
|------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| Find All Countries           | ‚úÖ         | Country |
| Find Country by Id           | ‚úÖ         | Country |
| Find Country by ISO2 code    | ‚úÖ         | Country |
| Find Country by ISO3 code    | ‚úÖ         | Country |
| Find Country by name         | ‚úÖ         | Country |
| Find Country by Native name  | ‚úÖ         | Country |
| Find Countries by State name | ‚úÖ         | Country |
| Find States by State name    | ‚úÖ         | State   |
| Find State by State Id       | ‚úÖ         | State   |
| Find States by State code    | ‚úÖ         | State   |
| Find City by City Id         | ‚úÖ         | City    |
| Find Cities by City name     | ‚úÖ         | City    |
| Search (free text)           | ‚úÖ         | Location |

location4j cannot find a location based on a small town, street or zipcode/postcode.


## Motivation üèóÔ∏è

Location data is very useful to have and provide when creating datasets for analysis, or APIs for
web/mobile.

After working with several expensive location services like Google's Geolocation API etc there was a
need for a simple solution that can provide useful data related to countries, their states and also
cities.

Writing code to parse a piece of free text was also lacking so location4j provides a search location
functionality.

Also the need to not require an external network call made by HTTP was a bonus too.

e.g.

```
"Glasgow, UK" ---> 1 result [Glasgow, United Kingdom]
"Santa Clara" ---> 16 results [Santa Clara, Argentina - Santa Clara, United States etc.]
"Santa Clara CA USA" ---> 1 result [Santa Clara, California, United States]
"Saxony" ---> 1 result [Saxony, Germany]

```


## Getting Started üöÄ

Get the latest version of the location4j library by adding it to your Maven or Gradle project.

```xml

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.tomaytotomato</groupId>
  <artifactId>location4j</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>


```


LocationService

```java

import com.tomaytotomato.LocationService;

public static void main(String[] args) {
  var locationService = new LocationService();
  var countries = locationService.findAllCountries();

  var europeanCountries = countries.stream().filter(country -> country.getRegion().equals("Europe"))
      .toList();

  var afghanistan = locationService.findCountryById(1);

  var cities = locationService.findAllCities("San Francisco"); //returns all cities around the world called San Francisco
}

```

LocationSearchService

```java


import com.tomaytotomato.SearchLocationService;

public static void main(String[] args) {

  var locationSearchService = new SearchLocationService();

  var results = locationSearchService.search(
      "Santa Clara"); // will find Santa Clara cities around the world

  var resultsUnitedStates = locationSearchService.search(
      "Santa Clara USA"); // will find Santa Clara cities in USA e.g. California, Utah etc.
  
  var resultsCalifornia = locationSearchService.search("Santa Clara CA"); // will find Santa Clara in California
  
}


```
