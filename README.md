location4j is a library that provides location data and location searching within a simple API.
There are no calls to 3rd party location services or LLMs. Just a simple location service for your
Java applications!

## Motivation üèóÔ∏è

Location data is very useful to have and provide when creating datasets for analysis, or APIs for
web/mobile.

After working with several expensive location services like Google's Geolocation API etc there was a
need for a simple solution that can provide useful data related to countries, their states and also
cities.

Writing code to parse a piece of free text was also lacking so location4j provides a search location
functionality.

Also the need to not require an external network call made by HTTP was a bonus too.

e.g.

```
"Glasgow, UK" ---> 1 result [Glasgow, United Kingdom]
"Santa Clara" ---> 16 results [Santa Clara, Argentina - Santa Clara, United States etc.]
"Santa Clara CA USA" ---> 1 result [Santa Clara, California, United States]
"Saxony" ---> 1 result [Saxony, Germany]

```
