location4j is a simple Java library designed for efficient and accurate geographical data lookups for countries, states, and cities. üó∫Ô∏è

Unlike other libraries, it operates without relying on third-party APIs, making it both cost-effective and fast. üèéÔ∏è

Its built-in dataset provides quick lookups and no need for external HTTP calls. üìÄ

## Quick Example üèó

```java
import com.tomaytotomato.SearchLocationService;

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SearchLocationService service = new SearchLocationService();

    // Find all locations named San Francisco
    List<Location> results = service.search("san francisco");
    printResults(results);

    // Narrow search to the US
    results = service.search("san francisco, us");
    printResults(results);

    // Narrow search further to California
    results = service.search("san francisco, us california");
    printResults(results);
  }

  private static void printResults(List<Location> results) {
    System.out.println("Locations found: " + results.size());
    results.forEach(location -> {
      System.out.println("Country: " + location.getCountryName());
      System.out.println("State: " + location.getStateName());
      System.out.println("City: " + location.getCityName());
    });
  }
}

```

## What can location4j do?

Here is an overview of the core functionality that location4j offers

| Feature                      | Supported | Object   |
|------------------------------|-----------|----------|
| Search (free text)           | ‚úÖ         | Location |
| Find All Countries           | ‚úÖ         | Country  |
| Find Country by Id           | ‚úÖ         | Country  |
| Find Country by ISO2 code    | ‚úÖ         | Country  |
| Find Country by ISO3 code    | ‚úÖ         | Country  |
| Find Country by name         | ‚úÖ         | Country  |
| Find Country by Native name  | ‚úÖ         | Country  |
| Find Countries by State name | ‚úÖ         | Country  |
| Find States by State name    | ‚úÖ         | State    |
| Find State by State Id       | ‚úÖ         | State    |
| Find States by State code    | ‚úÖ         | State    |
| Find City by City Id         | ‚úÖ         | City     |
| Find Cities by City name     | ‚úÖ         | City     |

üü¢ location4j can parse free text strings with or without punctuation or capitalisation e.g.
> San Francisco, CA, USA
> 
> ca united states san francisco
> 
> US, San Francisco, california

üî¥ location4j cannot find a location based on a small town, street, latitude/longitude or
zipcode/postcode

## Setup üöÄ

Get the latest version of the location4j library by adding it to your Maven pom.xml

```xml

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.tomaytotomato</groupId>
  <artifactId>location4j</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle**
```gradle
compile "com.tomaytotomato:location4j:1.0.0"
```

## Examples

**Lookup countries**

```java

import com.tomaytotomato.LocationService;

public class LocationServiceExample {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    LocationService locationService = new LocationService();

    // Get all countries
    List<Country> countries = locationService.findAllCountries();

    // Filter European countries
    List<Country> europeanCountries = countries.stream()
        .filter(country -> "Europe".equals(country.getRegion()))
        .toList();

    // Find Afghanistan by ID
    Country afghanistan = locationService.findCountryById(1);

    // Find all cities named San Francisco
    List<City> cities = locationService.findAllCities("San Francisco");

  }
}

```

**Search locations**

```java

import com.tomaytotomato.SearchLocationService;

public class LocationSearchServiceExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SearchLocationService locationSearchService = new SearchLocationService();

    // Search for Santa Clara
    List<Location> results = locationSearchService.search("Santa Clara");

    // Search for Santa Clara in the USA
    List<Location> resultsUnitedStates = locationSearchService.search("Santa Clara USA");

    // Search for Santa Clara in California
    List<Location> resultsCalifornia = locationSearchService.search("Santa Clara US CA");
  }
}

```

## Motivation üå±

Parsing location data efficiently is crucial for many applications, yet it can be complex and time-consuming. 

Third-party services like Google Location API can be costly, and using large language models can introduce significant latency. 

location4j offers a practical solution with its own dataset, enabling fast and cost-effective geographical lookups to a city/town level (which is sufficient in most cases).

This allows applications to be built without another external dependency and the overheads that come with it.

I may add other functionality in the future if needed e.g. geolocation to nearest place, geofencing etc.
