location4j is a library that provides location data and location searching within a simple API.

There are no calls to 3rd party Geolocation services e.g. (Google Maps) or LLMs like ChatGPT. 

location4j can parse and retrieve countries, states and cities from simple text formatted or unformatted.

e.g. 

```
"Santa Clara CA US" ===> {country:US}. {state:CA}, {city:Santa Clara} ===> 1 location found ===> Santa Clara, California, United States
"Santa Clara, California, United States" ===> {country:United States}. {state:California}, {city:Santa Clara} ===> 1 location found ===> Santa Clara, California, United States
"Gloucester" ===> {city:Gloucester} ===> 3 locations found ===> Gloucester, United Kingdom // Gloucester, Australia // Gloucester, United States
```

## Motivation üèóÔ∏è

Location data is very useful to have and provide when creating datasets for analysis, or APIs for
web/mobile.

After working with several expensive location services like Google's Geolocation API etc there was a
need for a simple solution that can provide useful data related to countries, their states and also
cities.

Writing code to parse a piece of free text was also lacking so location4j provides a search location
functionality.

Also the need to not require an external network call made by HTTP was a bonus too.

e.g.

```
"Glasgow, UK" ---> 1 result [Glasgow, United Kingdom]
"Santa Clara" ---> 16 results [Santa Clara, Argentina - Santa Clara, United States etc.]
"Santa Clara CA USA" ---> 1 result [Santa Clara, California, United States]
"Saxony" ---> 1 result [Saxony, Germany]

```

  var europeanCountries = countries.stream().filter(country -> country.getRegion().equals("Europe"))
      .toList();

  var afghanistan = locationService.findCountryById(1);

  var cities = locationService.findAllCities("San Francisco"); //returns all cities around the world called San Francisco
}

```

LocationSearchService

```java


import com.tomaytotomato.SearchLocationService;

public static void main(String[] args) {

  var locationSearchService = new SearchLocationService();
